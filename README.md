# Product Similarity Analysis with FAISS and NLP
This project focuses on analyzing product similarities using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and FAISS for efficient similarity search. The notebook demonstrates a pipeline for preprocessing product data, removing stopwords, tokenizing product names, and computing similar products within predefined product families.

## Features
- **Product Similarity Analysis**:
  - Uses `CountVectorizer` for vectorizing text data.
  - FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for fast similarity search.
- **Data Filtering and Grouping**:
  - Products grouped by family and filtered by predefined ranges of product counts.
- **NLP Preprocessing**:
  - Tokenization and stopword removal for better text representation.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**:
  - Uses Truncated SVD for optimized processing of high-dimensional data.
 
## Requirements
The project requires the following Python packages:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `faiss`
- `nltk`
- `gensim`
- `tqdm`
